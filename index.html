                    Sometimes something small can make us feel strong. Chloe
                    Dryden has learned this through her work as a tattoo artist.
                    Through her craft, she has discovered the power of
                    self-expression, helping people realise their identity
                    through storytelling, art and beauty. Throughout her work
                    and life, she finds strength and joy in seeing others
                    discover the power within themselves. “Strong today means
                    being assertive, but also aware of other people's
                    situations,” says Chloe. “Being able to advocate for those
                    people as well as yourself.”

                    Visual artist Daragh McCann has always been concerned with
                    finding his own people. He came to the UK as an immigrant
                    and, as a person with autism, it took him time to find and
                    connect with a queer community he could call home. He’s
                    redefined his own personal understanding of masculinity,
                    discarding the old school stereotypes and embracing more
                    nuanced ideas of strength. “Strength has these connotations
                    of bravado and masculinity,” he says. “Unwavering strength.

                    Growing up, Geethika struggled with feeling neither “white
                    enough” or “Indian enough. After rejecting the traditional
                    career path, she had the resolve to follow her dreams all
                    the way to acting school – but discovered a toxic lack of
                    diversity. Despite the adversity, she had the strength to
                    remain her truly authentic self, and has become a bright
                    young star in the acting world. “I used to reject my
                    culture,” she says. “But I'm finally now in a place where I

                  In the queer community, solidarity is so important. When you

                    When H Holliday came out as masc-presenting non-binary, they
                    found a new kind of strength existed within them. It’s a
                    type of strength we don’t talk about enough: one that is
                    defined by sensitivity, and fostered in the collective
                    compassion of a group that looks out for one another. An
                    artist and photographer, H’s story is one that speaks to the
                    solidarity of the queer community and the creativity a found
                    family can sustain and nurture. “When you have a support

                    The idea of home and belonging are abstract and complicated
                    concepts to the artist Maggie Chen. Born in Beijing, her
                    mother lives in Europe, her father in China, and she’s
                    attended university in both the US and the UK. Holding onto
                    her heritage as she’s moved through the world has provided
                    her with a unique challenge, which she explores in her art.
                    For Chen, strength is about finding balance in the moments
                    that lurk between power and weakness.“Life is always
                    changing, and it's unrealistic to hold yourself up to a

                    Punk rock is a genre that’s concerned with power; not
                    wielding power over others, but with unleashing your own
                    inner strength. It’s a spirit that is alive and well in the
                    eclectic rock and roll four-piece Whobodyhow, led by the
                    unflappable Milo Massey. Milo’s radical self-expression is
                    rooted in a rejection of traditional, patriarchal notions of
                    strength, and this has allowed him to unlock new depths in
                    his creative practice. “People are starting to find their
                    voice in society, and find their individual power,” he says.

                    Originally from Lagos, and now based in London, Motherlan
                    are a skate crew like no other. They see things differently,
                    and together they’ve set the agenda for what it means to be
                    a skater from Nigeria. And like many of the game-changing
                    skate crews that have preceded and inspired them, their
                    vision stretches much further than their boards. Motherlan
                    is a multidisciplinary outfit; a streetwear brand and a
                    creative collective who are dreaming big. It’s a confidence

                    Whether operating as a solo artist, or as half of
                    genre-defying, high-octane rap duo Yurufuwa Gang, NENE’s
                    energy is unmistakable. The kaleidoscopic quality of her
                    music, and the playful but daring edge to her performances,
                    are hallmarks of one of Japan’s most exciting and
                    experimental emerging artists. A musician who has no problem
                    pushing boundaries and seeing what works - even if that
                    means taking a few wrong turns along the way. As Nene puts
                    it: “Admitting to failure and learning from failure makes
                    you stronger.”

                    Singer-songwriter Niko Rubio understands that great music
                    comes from truth. As a first-generation Mexican living in
                    America, her lyrics incorporate Spanish and English, a
                    reflection of the cultural heritage that has shaped her and
                    her voice. Now based in California, her lush, sunny sound
                    also speaks to the coastal state she now calls home. "I
                    think the most important thing that you can do is be true to
                    yourself,” Niko says. “And that's what's going to make you

                  People think that to be strong you have to be really fierce,
                  really macho — all of these traditional ways of being strong.
                  But when you are your most vulnerable self, there's so much

                    We often discover just how strong we are when we least
                    expect it. Oduenyi Nwike discovered this when they moved to
                    the UK from their native Ireland, a young poet nervous about
                    where their place in this new city was, as a young queer
                    artist. They quickly found a new home though, among a
                    community that welcomed them and their immersive, expressive
                    spoken word. “When you are your most vulnerable self,

                    Saskia Horton is a classically trained musician and
                    technically gifted performance artist who has excelled in
                    every artistic discipline she’s explored. She’s also a
                    powerful advocate for disabled people, having been diagnosed
                    herself with ME (chronic fatigue syndrome) at the height of

                    It takes strength to make change. And strength comes when we
                    work together. Nobody knows this better than Xiuhtezcatl
                    Martinez. As a musician and activist he’s been challenging
                    social and environmental challenges facing us all, with a
                    particular focus on the significant threats posed to
                    indigenous and other marginalized communities by climate
                    change. Formerly the Youth Director of Earth Guardians, he’s
                    passionate about the power of education to inspire young
                    people to work together to create a better, fairer future.
                    “Power is built through collective imagination and
                    liberation. Strength is a reflection of that.”
